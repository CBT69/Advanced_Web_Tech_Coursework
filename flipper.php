						A cowboy came trotting through the vast desert on as he longed to
						reach the next town. His journey had been long and dusty but with his
						 horse (horse noise) by his side and his revolver (pistol noise) in
						 its holster he knew he was prepared for anything. As he travelled
						 on he noticed a figure standing in the distance.

					Upon closer inspection he noticed an old Indian chief standing next
					to a mine. “Oh great cowboy, how happy I am to see you” cried the
					Indian. “You must help me retrieve my sacred drum from this old mine
					and in return you may keep any of the copper, silver, and gold you
					find!” The cowboy thought about the offer before jumping off his
					horse and walking (spurs noise) over to the Indian chief.
					He smiled at the old Indian before exclaiming “I would be happy to
					help!” and off he went towards the mine. “Wait!” shouted the Indian,
					running after the cowboy. “Please take my head dress, it will protect
					 you from the monsters that protect your reward”. The cowboy nodded
					 politely before tucking the headdress under his arm and walking
					 (spurs noise) into the cave.

						As the cowboy entered the mine he could hear the wind howling
						(wind noise) behind him, pushing him deeper and deeper. Soon the
						cowboy approached a hyena that was guarding a small chest. The hyena
						stared and growled (hyena noise) at the cowboy, its eyes the size of
						bullets showing no fear. The cowboy thought for a minute before
						putting the headdress on and slowly walking towards the hyena. In an
						instant the hyena jumped aside, inviting the cowboy to the chest.
						Upon seeing all the copper in the chest the cowboy filled his pockets
						before proceeding further into the mine. It was not long before the
						cowboy came across another hyena, this one with eyes the size of
						cart wheels. The cowboy slowly crept towards the medium sized chest
						that was under the careful watch of the hyena before opening it to
						reveal more silver than he had ever seen before. It didn’t take long
						to empty all the copper out of his pockets (jingle noise) and then the
						 cowboy shovelled as much silver as he could in his boots and pockets.

						Continuing deeper into the mine the cowboy came across the largest
						hyena he had ever seen with eyes the size of a church. The
						cowboy was frozen with fear as he gazed at the mighty hyena but in
						the corner of the room he could see a huge chest bursting open with
						gold. Shaking with fear, the cowboy moved towards the chest, praying
						the old headdress would keep the hyena away. Sure enough the hyena
						left him as he opened the chest to reveal a mountain of gold. The
						cowboy filled his hat, boots, and pockets with gold before noticing
						something at the bottom of the chest. He dug deeper to reveal an old
						and worn bongo drum. The cowboy quickly grabbed it before rushing for
						 the exit of the mine, jingling all the way (jingle noise).

					“I have returned old Indian” shouted the cowboy as he emerged from
					the mine. “Before I give you this drum I must know why you needed it
					so desperately” announced the cowboy. The old Indian looked away
					before mumbling “I cannot tell you”. The cowboy was unhappy with
					the answer and threatened “I shall give you once chance to tell me
					and if you don’t then I shall have to shoot you”. The old Indian
					refused to meet the gaze of the cowboy and shook his head while
					holding his hand out for the drum. “Very well, you leave me no
					choice” said the cowboy, before drawing his revolver and shooting
					the Indian in the head (gun noise). The cowboy casually stepped over
					the body of the Indian before strapping the drum onto his horse and
					trotting off into the sunset (horse noise).

					As the cowboy entered town he noticed the saloon bar was offering a
					room to rent. He tied up his horse and walked towards the entrance,
					spurs jingling as he walked (jingle noise). The cowboy approached
					the bar (background chatter noise) and asked the barman for the
					finest room available with the nicest meal he could prepare.
					As the cowboy was making his way to his room he overheard some men
					discussing the sheriff’s daughter, who was kept on a far out ranch
					due to anyone who saw her beauty falling in love with her. The cowboy
					thought about how beautiful she must be as he lay in bed and wishes
					he could meet her one day. Each day the cowboy would spend his gold
					frivolously as he gave his new found wealth to anyone and everyone
					around him but every night his loneliness would make him think
					of the sheriff’s daughter.

					One evening the cowboy sat alone in his room, wishing for
					some form of companionship, when he reached for the old drum
					that had been gathering dust in the corner ever since he arrived.
					He slowly started to drum (drum noise) before getting quicker and
					quicker as he felt a strange energy flowing through him. Before
					long the first hyena (hyena noise) he encountered appeared before
					him and said “what is your command, master?” The cowboy could not
					believe his luck and asked to see the most beautiful girl in the
					world, the sheriff’s daughter. In an instant, the hyena disappeared
					 and returned with a girl asleep on his back. The cowboy was
					 speechless as he stared at this beautiful girl the hyena had
					 brought. He leaned in to kiss her (kiss noise) before
					  asking the hyena to return her to the far away ranch.

					The next morning the sheriff’s daughter woke and ran downstairs
					to tell her parents about the wonderful dream she had. While the
					sheriff listened he pretended to be happy for his daughter but deep
					down was worried about her. He asked one of his officers to keep a
					watch over his daughter during the next few nights to ensure she
					was safe. As the officer was watching the daughter sleep he could
					not believe his eyes when a hyena appeared in front of him and put
					the girl on his back before running off into the night. The office
					gave chase and followed the hyena all the way back to the saloon
					where he left a bottle of whisky outside of to allow him to show the
					sheriff the next day. As he crept away the hyena noticed his plan
					and proceeded to put a bottle of whiskey outside

			 The next morning the officer told the sheriff about what had happened
			 and lead him into town to show him who had stolen his daughter during
			 the night. Unfortunately every door had a bottle of whisky outside now
			 to the officer’s surprise. He looked at the sheriff and tried to stutter
			  an explanation but the sheriff would not listen and fired him on the
				spot. The sheriff stormed back to the ranch to make sure his daughter
				was still locked away from anyone who could fall in love with her and
				as he made his way back he came up with an idea to track his daughter
				 at night. By tying a small bag of gunpowder around her neck and
				 cutting a small hole in the bottom, he knew he could follow the
				 trail the next day to catch whoever was stealing her away. That
				 night, when the hyena returned to take the girl, the little bag
				 around her neck went unnoticed as she was carried to the saloon
				  which left a trail all through the town.</h5>

					With excitement and nervousness, the sheriff and three guards
					followed the trail of gunpowder through town. They arrived at the
					saloon (background chatter noise) to be greeted by the bar tender
					who asked how he could help. The sheriff demands to search the rooms
					for a hyena that has been stealing his daughter away each night
					before running up the stairs, followed closely by his armed guards
					(footsteps noise). They burst into the cowboy’s room before
					handcuffing him and dragging him away to the local jail where he
					 was told that when the sun rises he will be executed in the street.

			 <h5>As the night continued on the cowboy started to become more and
				 more worried about how he was going to escape from his impending
				 death. Then he realised what he needed to do and asked the guard to
				 fetch his drum so that he may say a final prayer. The guard could not
				 refuse such a reasonable request so sent someone to fetch the drum
				 from the saloon but warned the cowboy that he could not play until
				 the morning. By this point the cowboy knew all he could do was wait
				 so he decided to rest until the morning (snoring noise).</h5>

			 <h5>As the sun started to rise the sheriff marched into the jail and
				 threw a bucket of water over the sleeping cowboy, shouting “your
				 time is up, cowboy.” He dragged the cowboy out into the street in
				 front of a crowed of on-lookers. “Please, let me say one final prayer”
				  begged the cowboy. The sheriff looked displeased but knew he had to
					grant a dying man’s last wish. “Very well” he mumbled, while handing
					the drum to the cowboy. The cowboy’s eyes lit up as he started to
					drum, faster and faster to summon forth all three hyenas (hyena noise).</h5>

				 “Attack!” he screeched as he pointed towards the sheriff and his
				 guards. The hyenas leapt forward and tore the sheriff and his guards
				  into hundreds of tiny pieces (slashing noises). The daughter looked
					on, cowering in fear at the bloodshed, but she felt a sense of
					freedom to finally escape her father’s rule. The cowboy slowly
					walked over to her, went down on and knee, and proposed to her in
					 front of the whole town who cheered for them as the hyenas danced
					 around them.
