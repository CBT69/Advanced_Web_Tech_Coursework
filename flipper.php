						A cowboy came trotting through the vast, dry desert on his horse
						as he longed to reach the next town. Being exiled from his hometown
						had cost him dearly. Without a penny to his name and his mother
						murdered by law enforcement, he knew he would never be happy again.
						His journey had been long and supplies were running low but with his
						horse (horse noise) by his side and his revolver (pistol noise) in
						its holster he was prepared for trouble. As he travelled on he
						noticed a figure standing in the distance and he prayed they would
						point him to the nearest town.

				Upon closer inspection, he saw an old Indian chief standing next to a
				mine. “Great cowboy, how happy I am to see you” cried the Indian.
				“You must help me retrieve my sacred drum from this old mine and in
				return you may keep any of the copper, silver, and gold you find!” The
				cowboy debated what to do. Supplies were already running thin but the
				chance of limitless wealth intrigued him. The cowboy thought about the
				offer before jumping off his horse and walking (spurs noise) over to the
				Indian chief. He smiled at the old Indian before exclaiming “I would be
				happy to help! But when I return you must tell me where the nearest
				town is.” The cowboy quickly turned and strode off towards the mine.
				“Wait!” shouted the Indian, running after the cowboy. “Please take my
				head dress, it will protect you from the monsters that guard your reward”.
				The cowboy nodded politely and tried to hide his laughter before
				tucking the headdress under his arm and walking (spurs noise)
				into the cave.

					As the cowboy entered the mine he could hear the wind howling
					(wind noise) behind him, pushing him deeper and deeper. “My headdress
					will protect you from the monsters,” mocked the cowboy, laughing to
					himself at the absurdity of it. He wandered into a wide cave that
					felt much cooler than where he had come from (shiver noise). Three
					large doors stood before the cowboy, each one made of a different
					precious metal. Without hesitation, he approached and pushed the
					copper door and it slowly creaked open (door noise). This room was
					very small and in the centre sat a chest with a hyena watching over
					it. The hyena stared and growled (hyena noise) at the cowboy, its
					eyes the size of bullets showing no fear. The cowboy stared for a
					minute in disbelief at what he was seeing. Eventually he put the
					headdress on and slowly walking towards the hyena. In an instant the
					hyena jumped aside, inviting the cowboy to the chest. Upon seeing
					all the copper in the chest, the cowboy filled his pockets, unable
					to believe his luck, before returning to the main hall..

				A door crafted from silver was next for the cowboy to tackle. Pulling
				up his trousers, he marched confidently forward and pushed against the
				door. Again, the cowboy came across hyena, this one with eyes the size
				of cartwheels. The cowboy slowly crept towards the medium sized chest
				that was under the careful watch of the hyena before opening it to
				reveal more silver than he had ever seen before. The cowboy was
				sweating with excitement now as he started to picture the life he could
				lead. It did not take long to empty all the copper out of his pockets
				(jingle noise) and then the cowboy shovelled as much silver as he could
				into his boots and pockets. With great difficulty, he waddled back into
				the main hall, weighed down by the plunder he had taken.

					Now the cowboy turned his attention towards the gold door. This door
					was much heavier than the rest and required all of the cowboy’s
					strength to get it to budge. Eventually it swung open to reveal a
					path leading deeper into the mine. The cowboy continued onwards where
					he came across the largest hyena he had ever seen with eyes the size
					of a church. The cowboy had a wry smile on his lips as he gazed at
					the mighty hyena. While it may scare a lesser man, the cowboy had
					been through too much to suffer from fear. In the corner of the room,
					he could see a huge chest bursting open with gold. He licked his lips
					as he imagined the feast he could afford with the gold. The hyena
					watched carefully as the cowboy swapped all his silver pieces for gold
					coins. The cowboy filled his hat, boots, and pockets with gold before
					whistling for his horse (whistle noise) to come down so he could fill
					his saddlebag too. Just as the cowboy was about to leave, he noticed
					something at the bottom of the chest. He dug deeper to reveal an old
					and worn Indian drum. The cowboy quickly grabbed it before rushing for
					the exit of the mine, jingling all the way (jingle noise).

				“I have returned old Indian” shouted the cowboy as he emerged from the
				mine. “Before I give you this drum I must know why you needed it so
				desperately” announced the cowboy. The old Indian looked away before
				mumbling “I cannot tell you”. The cowboy saw anger flash across the
				face of the Indian but was unhappy with the answer and threatened “I
				shall give you once chance to tell me and if you do not then I shall
				have to shoot you where you stand”. The old Indian refused to meet the
				gaze of the cowboy and shook his head while holding his hand out for
				the drum. “Very well, you leave me no choice” said the cowboy, before
				drawing his revolver and shooting the Indian in the head (gun noise).
				The cowboy sighed, he did not enjoy killing but was not someone who
				went against his word. He casually stepped over the body of the Indian
				before strapping the drum onto his horse and trotting off into the sunset
				(horse noise).

					As the cowboy entered town he noticed the saloon bar was offering a
					room to rent. He tied up his horse and walked towards the entrance,
					spurs jingling as he walked (jingle noise). The cowboy approached the
					bar (background chatter noise) and asked the barman for the finest room
					available with the nicest meal he could prepare. The barman looked the
					cowboy up and down before laughing at his dusty, ragged clothes. “Of
					course Your Majesty, and how would you like to pay for that? Hopes and
					dreams, perhaps?” quipped the barman. Normally this disrespect would
					have angered the cowboy greatly but not on this day of immense wealth.
					The cowboy flicked three gold coins at the barman and winked, “Oh and
					throw your wife in too!” as the bar erupted into laughter.  As the
					cowboy was making his way to his room, he overheard some men
					discussing the sheriff’s daughter, who was kept on a far out ranch.
					The story went that anyone who saw her beauty would instantly fall in
					love with her. The cowboy thought about how beautiful she must be as
					he lay in bed and wished he could meet her one day.

					One evening the cowboy sat alone in his room, wishing for some form
					of companionship, when he reached for the old drum that had been
					gathering dust in the corner ever since he arrived. He slowly
					started to drum (drum noise) before getting quicker and quicker as
					he felt a strange energy flowing through him. Before long the first
					hyena (hyena noise) he encountered appeared before him and said “what
					is your command, master?” The cowboy could not believe his luck and
					asked to see the most beautiful girl in the world, the sheriff’s
					daughter. In an instant, the hyena disappeared and returned with a
					girl asleep on his back. The cowboy was speechless as he stared at
					the beautiful girl the hyena had brought. For the first time in
					months, the cowboy did not feel alone. He leaned in to kiss her
					(kiss noise) before asking the hyena to return her to the far away
					ranch.

						The next morning the sheriff’s daughter woke and ran downstairs to
						tell her parents about the wonderful dream she had. While the
						sheriff listened, he pretended to be happy for his daughter but
						deep down was worried about the prophecy he had heard from an old
						Indian chief he imprisoned long ago. He asked one of his officers
						to keep a watch over his daughter during the next few nights to
						ensure she was safe. The officer who was watching the daughter
						sleep could not believe his eyes when a hyena appeared in front of
						him later that night. The hyena proceeded to put the girl on his
						back before running off into the night. The office gave chase and
						followed the hyena all the way back to the saloon where he left a
						bottle of whisky outside of to allow him to show the sheriff the
						next day. As he crept away, the hyena noticed what had happened and
						proceeded to put a bottle of whiskey outside each door in town to
						ensure his master would not be found.

				The next morning the officer told the sheriff about what had happened
				and led him into town to show him who had stolen his daughter during
				the night. Unfortunately, every door had a bottle of whisky outside
				 now to the officer’s surprise. He looked at the sheriff and tried to
				 stutter an explanation but the sheriff would not listen and fired him
				 on the spot. The sheriff stormed back to the ranch to make sure his
				 daughter was still locked away from anyone who could fall in love with
				 her. As he made his way back, he came up with an idea to track his
				 daughter at night. By tying a small bag of gunpowder around her neck
				 and cutting a hole in the bottom, he knew he could follow the trail
				 the next day to catch whoever was stealing her away. That night, when
				 the hyena returned to take the girl, the little bag around her neck
				 went unnoticed as she was carried to the saloon, leaving a trail all
				 through the town.

					With excitement and nervousness, the sheriff and two guards followed
					the trail of gunpowder through town. They arrived at the saloon
					(background chatter noise) to be greeted by the bar tender who asked
					how he could help. The sheriff demanded to search the rooms for a
					hyena that has been stealing his daughter away each night. The barman
					invited them to search anywhere as they would find no hyena in his
					bar. The sheriff then noticed the trail of gunpowder leading up the
					stairs. “Come on men!” he shouted, before running up the stairs, followed
					closely by his armed guards (footsteps noise). They burst into the
					cowboy’s room just as he was escaping out of the window. He had
					overheard the noise the guards were causing and knew that he had been
					caught. As the cowboy jumped out of the window, both the sheriff and his
					guards gave chase. The cowboy only made it half way down the street
					 before he realised he had left both his horse and the drum behind.
					 Cursing under his breath, he continued at full sprint but could
					 already hear the galloping of horses behind him (galloping noise).
					 He tried desperately to dodge down the side of a building when he
					 felt a tightness across his chest. The sheriff had managed to lasso
					 the runaway criminal and pulled hard to trip him as he ran. The
					 cowboy was slung over the back of the sheriff’s horse and told
					 that he was to be executed at sunrise.

				As the night continued on the cowboy started to become more and more
				worried about how he was going to escape from his impending death.
				Then he realised what he needed to do. “Guard! Guard!” shouted the
				cowboy. “I need you to go and retrieve my drum so that I may say a
				prayer before I am shot.” The guard could not refuse such a reasonable
				request so sent someone to fetch the drum from the saloon but warned
				the cowboy that he could not play until the morning. By this point the
				cowboy knew all he could do was wait so he decided to rest until the
				morning (snoring noise).

					As the sun started to rise, the sheriff marched into the jail and
					threw a bucket of water over the sleeping cowboy, shouting “your
					time is up, cowboy.” He dragged the cowboy out into the street in
					front of a crowd of on-lookers. “Please, let me say one final prayer”
					 begged the cowboy. The sheriff looked displeased but knew he had to
					 grant a dying man’s last wish. “Very well” he mumbled, while handing
					 the drum to the cowboy. The cowboy’s eyes lit up as he started to
					 drum, faster and faster to summon forth all three hyenas
					 (hyena noise). “Attack!” he screeched as he pointed towards the
					 sheriff and his guards. The hyenas leapt forward and tore the
					 sheriff and his guards into hundreds of tiny pieces (slashing noises).
					 The daughter looked on, cowering in fear at the bloodshed, but she
					 felt a sense of freedom to finally escape her father’s rule. The
					 cowboy slowly walked over to her, went down on and knee, and
					 proposed to her in front of the whole town who cheered for them as
					 the hyenas danced around them.
