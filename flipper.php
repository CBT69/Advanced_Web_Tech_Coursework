			 <h5>The story starts with a description of the cowboy (listener) wandering
				 through a desert with his horse and revolver as
				 he makes his way towards the nearest town. He is stopped by an old Indian
				 chief who asks a favour of him. The cowboy is asked to go in the mine to
				 retrieve an old drum and may keep any of the copper, silver, and gold he finds along the way.
				 Indian gives him his headdress to protect him from the hyenas.</h5>

 				 who start aggressive but then become passive when they see the headdress.
 				 Once he finds the drum in the last room he returns to the old Indian chief and asks why the drum is needed.
 				 After the Indian won’t tell him he shoots him with his revolver.</h5>

				 and orders a room to stay with lots of food and drink.
				 Overhears old men talking about the beautiful sheriff’s daughter who is locked away on a far out ranch.
				 Unable to find a way to see her the cowboy eventually runs out of money and has to sleep behind a house
				 in the town. As a way of trying to make money he plays the drum which summons the hyenas who offer to
				 do what he asks. They bring him money and he goes back to living well at the saloon.</h5>

				 The daughter tells her father of the dream. Next night the sheriff has an officer
				 watch over his daughter and follows the hyena as he brings the girl to the cowboy.
				 The officer marks where the dog goes by leaving a bottle of whisky at the door but the hyena then
				 copies this and puts whisky at every door in town.
				 After this fails the sheriff uses a trail of gunpowder to track where the hyena takes his
				 daughter and so he can follow it the next day.</h5>
