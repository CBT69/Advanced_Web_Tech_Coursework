# Digital Storytelling Project
The aim of this group project was to create an interactive e-book, presenting a designated story in convention specified in requirements. In this case, "The Tinderbox" by Andersen, in the realities of the wild west. I was responsible for defining the functionality and creating the code.

The application had to be available in the browser, ensure simple and clear navigation, show advanced use of interactivity and responsiveness techniques, compliance with the designated topic, aesthetic and professional appearance.

The project is mainly made using JavaScript embedded in PHP and HTML. The overall structure is simple and only the use of JS gives it the final effect. 

Requires Virtual Environment (e.g. XAMPP) to run.
